# UniversityEdits
@UniversityEdits is a Twitter bot that automatically tweets whenever someone from a University campus anonymously edits the Wikipedia page of another (or their own) University.

---

The list of monitored wikipedia pages can be found in MonitoredPages.txt. The list of monitored IP ranges (and their corresponding institutions) can be found in IP_Ranges.txt. To add schools to either list, send a pull request, or tweet @UniversityEdits. If you don't know the IP ranges allocated for your school, don't worry! Just tweet @UniversityEdits and I can look it up.
